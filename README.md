## 2D Puzzle Platformer Game

The objective is to try and find a way to make it to the end of the level without being caught by the Wendingo (the enemy of the story).


## My contributions
I had joined the group halfway through the prototyping of the game. The main functionality was already in place. Here is a list of my contributions:

- Added the Main menu
- Updated the Pause menu to look and work much better
- Resetting the obstacles when the player dies
- Fixing the Checkpoint system
- Helped create a rope that the player can swing on
- Added animations from spritesheets provided by the art team
- Creating a torch the player can hold to give the scene more light
- Added a pulley system where the player must place an obstacle on top of a platform to advance (opens a door or raises another platform)
- Added Game Sound
  - Menu sounds
  - Background noises in game that are directional
  - Footsteps that change based on the type of ground you are running on
