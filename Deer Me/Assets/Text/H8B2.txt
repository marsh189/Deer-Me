I hear it stalking me. It comes to the house every night. I hear its scratching to my left, then to my right, then th left again and left again.
It never stops.
I just ate my last berry. Though I have only been postponing the inevitable, I feel like this was the last tick of the clock.
Now I just have to wait. Raven
