June 22nd. Yesterday was the Summer Solstice. You would think with the snow gone for good and the sun warming us from the sky above that we should be content. 
We are not content. I am worried, Diary, about my team. Is team the right word? Lately it feels like working together is just short of impossible.
Last week, Michael's youngest died of malnutrition. She wasn't getting enough protein, I guess, and he couldn't get her to eat anything that didn't taste good. 
It's been... A rough few days, for everyone, but for his family most of all. I think we're all hanging on by a thread. Love, Caitlin
