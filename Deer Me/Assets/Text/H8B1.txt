I think I am alone. I don't know - I haven't been outside in a while, and honestly I stopped counting the days weeks ago - but I just get this feeling that everyone I knew is gone. 
Deer Creek is dead, and so are its people. Stolen in the night by a creature that used to be a part of this community, and has single-handedly ripped it apart. It isn't Michael anymore. 
I feel like I should be afraid, but all I feel is sadness. We did not deserve this. Raven
