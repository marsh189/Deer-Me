July 17th, 1973. Michael has been gone for 11 days. Who knows where the children are? Meghan is gone now too, along with Charlie and Vince, and Raven hasn't left her house in days. 
Caitlin and I spend hours just sitting on the roof, staring into the distance, because there just isn't anything to do anymore. 
I'm scared, honestly, that we are supposed to be here for another five months. The way things have gone, I'll be surprised if we last until August. 
Where is HEC in all of this? They promised us change and a brighter future, but our future seems like it lies only in the darkness among the trees. 
The Human Experimental Corporation has done so much good for the world, haven't they? How could they treat us like this? Matt
