May 18th, 1973. Game is getting scarcer. Meghan seems to be doing fine, being a vegetarian and all, but the rest of us are struggling.
I overheard Michael saying he might go to a grocery store soon if things don't start looking up.
I mean, I can't blame him, but that's not what we're here for.
I think I'll just start sharing my haul with him and his family - there is only one of me, after all, and Michael is still having trouble coping with our unique situation.
Maybe more than the rest of us. I just hope he has the common sense not to ruin this for us all. Vince.
