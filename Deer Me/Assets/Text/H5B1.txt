June 1st. Dear Diary, I'm starting to think this wasn't such a good idea. I know we all agreed to be here, and HEC said they'd be monitoring us from afar if things started to go wrong, but things are going very wrong and we haven't heard from anyone outside the community.
I've been trying to remember what is was they told us when they recruited us, something along the lines of understanding human nature within the context of nature itself, but I'm losing sense of what the real purpose was.
It seemed clear all those months ago, but for the life of me, I have no idea what I'm doing here. People are starting to get vicious. Meghan.
