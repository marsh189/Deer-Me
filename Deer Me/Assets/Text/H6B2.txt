July 6th. Today, Michael disappeared, along with his remaining children. I don't know where he went - Vince thinks he bailed on us, but I believe he's better than that.
I'm conflicted, however, because that's the only scenario in which I can imagine he's safe. I'm afraid, for him and for us. How can this get any worse? Love, Caitlin
