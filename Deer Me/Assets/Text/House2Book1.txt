We have arrived. So far, my home is a tent made of sticks and tarp, but soon we will begin construction on real houses.
Caitlin suggested we build them in the trees to protect us from the wildlife, but honestly, we were here to be closer to nature, and that includes the wildlife, no?
Oh well, it's one against sixteen. To the trees we go. I'll just befriend the squirrels and birds instead. Signed, Charlie
